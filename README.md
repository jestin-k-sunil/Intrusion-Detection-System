# Intrusion-Detection-System
This project presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect and classify network intrusions. Trained on the CICIDS2017 dataset, the model enhances threat detection by generating realistic attack patterns and improving the robustness of classification against malicious traffic.
